### Instructions to work on a Django project in pycharm
To create project
- django-admin startproject project_name . 
- "." at end tells to start project at current directory

To create an app in Django project
- django-admin startapp app_name

To run app (two ways)
1) python manage.py runserver (or)
2) In run --> Edit config --> Add config 
    - path: project_name/manage.py
    - parameters: runserver

Everytime we create an app, needs to add it in "INSTALLED_APPS" variable
in settings.py file

When Building APIs in Django, we don't need "sessions" app so we can delete
it from settings.py file

We need to map our urls to functions so that each url redirects to specific target (Internal app mappings)
- So add "urls.py" file in app folder and configure
- ex: urlpatterns = [path('hello', views.say_hello)] - here say_hello is method name and 
views is file name that contains the method

Next, we need to configure URL path in main urls.py (present in project folder) (External app mappings)
- ex: urlpatterns = [path('app_name/', include('app_name.urls')]
